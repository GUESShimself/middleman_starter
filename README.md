My Middleman Starter
====================

Ain't nothin' but a starter project template for the [Middleman static site generator](http://middlemanapp.com/) that steals heavily from [Nathan Henderson's Amicus](https://github.com/nathos/amicus) and [Ben Smithett's Style](https://github.com/bensmithett/style) for maximum [BEM](http://bem.info/), [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/), and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). sssssss. sss. s.

### How do I even?
- You'll want to `$ gem install middleman` if you don't already have it (and read the [documentation](http://middlemanapp.com/getting-started/)).
- `$ git clone http://github.com/tombryan/middleman_starter.git my_sweet_project`
- `$ bundle install` maybe I'm not sure don't look at me like that.
- `$ cd my_sweet_project && bundle exec middleman server`
- Make something *awesome*.

### lolwut?
This is still very much a WIP and **also** it is put together for the way *I* like to do things. If *you* like to do things a different way you should just do that and *stop yelling at me*.
